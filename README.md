# pastaTune
this is the time search enabled youtube engine found in fotisbalampanis.com/pastaTune

By using the scripts in this repo along with jQuery, jQueryUI and some simple page,
you can search youTube by using time.. of course things become simpler when you already have something in mind.
It would be great to only use time wouldn't be?

In next versions, probably the commented part of showing a carousel of thumbnails of the results is going to be implemented for the user to choose.

The final version is supposed to work without a query, by using only time.

Any requests or suggestions are welcome.

Cheers and cook some pasta
